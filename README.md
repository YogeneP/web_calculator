# web_calculator
study microproject to obtain the experience of web-app components interaction

Have no idea how it should work...

Main idea: 
html/css/js frontend:
buttons, input field, data exchange
c++ backend:
calculation, data exchange

Data transfer modes to learn and test:
JSON objects
what else?
Corresponding c++ libraries needed to compose/parce JSON (my suggestion):
https://github.com/nlohmann/json
https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson - guess right choice for further projects

What's SAX/DOM style API 

Simple webserver implementation - Node.js
Not  needed anything stronger yet

It goes further toward more global math-app with rapid data flow there and back, so the just way to code current task using JS is not considered.
